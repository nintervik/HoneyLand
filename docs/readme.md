## **Project overview** 

This project consist of a small 10 minutes gameplay demo. This game project will put in practice the concepts of the IA classes we've done in university. 

The game is based in a honey farm. The main goal is to make the business profitable.

Agents move with our own coded steering behaviours and its general behaviours work with beahviour trees. The movement uses [Recast](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/recastunity-recast-for-unity-7041) to calculate the path and [NodeCanvas](http://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/) has been used as a visual behaviour framework.

This project has been done by two catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).
