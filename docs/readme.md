## **Our project** 

Project for Videogame Development subject. The main goal here is to create a simple plattaformer with two levels done in Tiled, having a main character moving around while being able to save and load game’s state. On top of this enemies pathfinding is implemented along other stuff such as stable frame rate (30fps), normalized movement, structured entity system described in an UML file and code with Brofiler integration. We also have added an intro menu and HUD implemented through a strucured ui system described in a UML file. 

This project has been done by two catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).

## **About the game**

Simple platformer with a temple-type theme featuring a yellow character. Equipped with a gun, he will have to reach the end of the level avoiding obstacles and killing enemies.

## **Main core subsystems of the game**

Our game code is structured in modules. The main module (called j1App.cpp) manages all the other modules calling in a loop its respective awake, preupdate, update, postupdte, cleanup that they share thorugh a base class j1Module. Down below a basic scheme of this (some modules are missing) shows what has been explained:

For a better organization and performance a entity factory system has been implemented along with an UI module that manages all the events that happen in UI and it's independent to everything else.

Animations, file paths, and levels are read and loaded through parsing xml files to avoid 'magic numbers', improve readability and boost changes when testing. 

### Innovations
* Player and enemy animations are read from an xml file.
* Spawn enemy points are created with Tiled and read from the tmx file of the map.
* Pause menu implemented.
* You can change game language (dictionary read from an xml file) in settings: available in english, spanish, catalan... and even klingon if you don't belong to our planet!

## **Tools used**
* IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
* Language: C++
* Graphics and audio: SDL 2.0
* Data: pugixml 1.8
* Level editor: Tiled 0.17
* Profiler: Brofiler
* Code repository: GitHub
* Others: Adobe Photoshop CS6, MS Paint and Aseprite

## **How to play**

The game is quite simple. You must reach the end of each level (there are two) collecting all the coins you can while killing enemies and avoiding obstacles. You start with three lives but every time you collect 10 coins you earn an extra life (up to 6). you can can consult game controls down below. Have fun!
